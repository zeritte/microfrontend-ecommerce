# E-commerce Microfrontend App

A very simple microfrontend app built with webpack.

3 separate terminal windows;

```
cd container && npm install && npm start
```

```
cd cart && npm install && npm start
```

```
cd products && npm install && npm start
```

Then visit `localhost:8080` to see all the apps working together.
